Questions
The game always starts off with:

"Did you play Explorers of Time or Explorers of Darkness?"
This does not give any personality points by itself, but if "Yes" is answered, certain Natures will have points added to them after the player has chosen their gender. These correspond to the new choices of Pokémon available in Explorers of Sky - Phanpy, Shinx, and Riolu if male; Vulpix and Eevee if female.

Additionally, the following Pokémon's base recruit rate will be doubled as long as the player has not recruited them already. Most of these can be found in dungeons found at various points of the main story; Pokémon marked with a dagger (†) can be recruited only after the credits roll, while Feraligatr (§) has special conditions. Furthermore, Porygon2, Rampardos, Bastiodon and Bronzong internally use these doubled rates, but cannot be found in any dungeons that allow for recruitment.

Afterwards, 8 of the following questions will be asked at random. After these questions, the player will be asked for their gender.

 (Only if "Yes" was answered for "Did you play Explorers of Time or Explorers of Darkness?")
After answering the questions and choosing their gender, the player is asked to place their finger on the Touch Screen to determine the color of their aura; this is used to determine the color of Bow that is included in the Pokémon Exploration Team Kit. In reality, the aura color is decided upon based on either the player's favorite color in the DS system settings (75%) or the DS system's MAC address (25%). Afterwards, the player's Nature and Pokémon are revealed.
