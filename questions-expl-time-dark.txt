After answering the questions and choosing their gender, the player is asked to place their finger on the Touch Screen to determine the color of their aura; this is used to determine the color of Bow that is included in the Pokémon Exploration Team Kit. In reality, the aura color is decided upon based on either the player's favorite color in the DS system settings (75%) or the DS system's MAC address (25%). Afterwards, the player's Nature and Pokémon are revealed.
